## 👽👾 Rick and Morty API 

My application aims to solve the question of people who are starting to watch Rick and Morty and don't know very well what the animated series is about, don't know who the characters are - if they are alive, what planet they are from, etc.
As this is a complex design, involving many universes, many may not understand very well what is happening, so this API shows details of some characters, explains about the pilot of the series and sends the user to a website that has detailed information made by the fandom itself.

## 📲 Execution Instructions 

To use this application, it is extremely easy.

- The first screen shows the API with all the characters selected, when you scroll down you can see them.

- When pressing on each character, a modal will open with more specific information about it.

- The second screen shows information about the first episode (or pilot episode).

- When clicking on the top information icon, another modal will open with instructions on how to use the API, followed by a link that takes the user to a site with more specific information about the Rick and Morty series.

## ✨ Layout 

This application was made for the colors to be adjusted according to the user's preference. If your cell phone is in dark mode, the application will be in dark theme; if in light mode, the application will be in light mode.

## 😥 Limitations 

I chose not to show all existing characters, since there are more than 400, so the limitation was having only placed some characters, not all.

## 🐛 Known bugs 

There is a bug in the declaration of the image's uri type in the character's specific modal screen, it's a bug that, even though it exists, still lets the image show normally.

## 🚀 Next steps 

- Include all characters;
- Let the user choose which episode will be described on the second screen (instead of leaving the pilot episode fixed).
